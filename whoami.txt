As a builder at heart, I enjoy developing software that not only focuses on customer- centricity, but also implements positivity and efficiency. My motivation comes from the fact that others can benefit from what I built; the satisfaction that comes from solving real world problems keeps me growing and moving forward. I enjoy building and working on products within a team, and I hope to do so in an envrionment where everyone encourages on bringing happiness in other people's lives.
