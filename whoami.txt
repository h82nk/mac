As a builder at heart, I enjoy developing software that not only focuses on customer- centricity, but also implements positivity and efficiency. My motivation comes from the fact that others can benefit from what I built; the satisfaction that comes from solving real world problems keeps me grow and move forward. I would enjoy to build and work on products within a team, in which I can build software that enables happiness in other people's lives.
